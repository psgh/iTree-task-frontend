# Launching the project

After obtaining a copy of the project on your local machine navigate to the installation directory using a terminal application.

Ensure that you have Node.js installed and available on your path.

Run commands "npm install" and "npm start" and the project will launch.

Alternatively, open this project using your favourite IDE and use the built-in tools of said IDE to launch the project.

It is strongly suggested to launch the server application first.
